<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
The goal of this assignment is to track multiple objects from frame to fram and 
display a history of each object's paths. The objective of this project is to 
learn more about the practical issues that arise when designing a tracking system
using computer vision.  There are two sets of dataset that has been provided for 
experiement, Bat dataset and Acqurium dataset. In this project, we use the Bat dataset 
as input to the system for analysis. 
</p>
<hr>
<h2> Problem Topics </h2>
<p>
In the project, we used kalman filter to estimate the position of the object from frame to frame
and used hungarian algorithm to associate the data points from each estimation to the objects 
near the estimated data points. 
<br>
<br>
The following are description of method and implemenation of multiple tracking algorithm using kalman filter and 
hungarian algorithm:
</p>

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<h3 style="text-indent: 10px;"> (1) Obtain Objects from Bat dataset  </h3>
<p>
In this project, we used a Bat dataset with provided list of detected object in each frame to 
use the optimal segmentation of object. 
<br><br>
Once each image/frame was read, the tracks for tracking the object is initialized
for all objects detected in the image. 
</p>

<p>
Each object was initialized with a date structure that stores Kalman Filter information, 
traces (tracks), prediction and measurement, as shown below:

</p>
<pre>
		struct Objtrack {
			vector<Point2d> traces;
			KalmanFilter KF;
			Point2d prediction;
			Mat_<float> measurement;
		};
</pre>


<h3 style="text-indent: 10px;"> (2) Estimate the Position of the Object using Kalman Filter </h3>
<p>
In order to implement the estimation step, we implemented the Kalman filter. 
The openCV Kalman Filter library was used to compute the kalam filter. 
</p>

<p> Inititalization of Kalman Filter </p>

<h3 style="text-indent: 10px;"> (3) Data Association Method to Track the Objects in the Frame </h3>
<p>
For the data association method, the hugarian algorithm was used. A third party library 
was used for integrating the experiement data and the kalman filter implemenation. 
</p>

<p>
Also, a maximum distance was set for the track, to consider cases
when the object disappears from the image. 
</p>

<p>
Also, when a track is not assigned to any object in the fram, the track is deleted. 
When an object is not assigned to any track in the frame, a new track is created. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-indent: 10px;">
(5) Draw the track
</h3>
<p> Once all the estimated position of the object is associated with the oject's 
position in the image, the trace of each object is displayed in a for-loop
using a random color assignment. 
</p>

<pre>
			for (int k = 0; k < tracks.size(); k++){
				unsigned char r = 255 * (rand() / (1.0 + RAND_MAX));
				unsigned char g = 255 * (rand() / (1.0 + RAND_MAX));
				unsigned char b = 255 * (rand() / (1.0 + RAND_MAX));
				Scalar Color = Scalar(r, g, b);
				
				if (tracks[k].traces.size() > 1)
				{
					for (int i = 0; i < tracks[k].traces.size() - 1; i++) {
						line(binary3C, tracks[k].traces[i], tracks[k].traces[i + 1], Color, 2, CV_AA);
				}
			}
</pre>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>
In order to test the object tracking algorithm using kalman filter and 
hungarian algorithm, we adjusted the kalman filter value Q to see how
the tracking behaves. 
</p>

<p>
The kalman filter 'Q' matrix (noise process covariance) to see how the algorithm 
behaves in tracking the object and how the algorithm can be improved to 
track the objects in the image. 
</p>

<p>
The experiment was performed on following image:
<img src="Z:\public_html\cs585\A4\img\labeledori.png">
</p>

<p>
The evaluation of the algorithm was based on how the algorithnm 
accurately tracks the same assgined object. 
</p>

<hr>
<h2> Results</h2>
<p>
The algorithm did not do a good job of tracking the bats correctly.

<h2> Discussion </h2>

<h3> Discussion of Tracking Results </h3>
<p>
The tracking result was not very successful. The estimation of the data point in the kalman filter 
was significantly off. 
</p>

<h3>Decision to Begin & Terminate a Track</h3>
<p>
A track is terminated when it is not assigned to any object in the 
specific frame. 
</p>
<p>
A new track is created when there is an object but has not been 
assigned to any track in the image. 
</p>

<h3>Obervation of Objects When Occluded</h3>
<p>
In the lecture, we learnt that when the objects are occluded, they 
are identified as two object very close each other and the 
data association method may not assign the track to correct object. 
When they are occluded and detected as a single object by the image 
segmentation result, the algorithm will only track one object and 
another track will be deleted. When the object seperate again in the
susequent frame, a new track is created. 
</p>

<p>
However, a better method is to have a single object to be assigned with 
multiple tracks and have multiple tracks shown in the resulting frame until
they are seperated from each other.  The direction and object is still difficult to 
assign and the data association method may not be able to determine the same object. 
</p>

<p>
One improvement may be gathering additional characteristics of the object, such as size, 
circularity, orientation and angle of the object as part of track history and 
by looking at multiple frame - before & after occulsion - to correctly determin the 
object's path to improve data association assignment. 
We can also use velocity and accelation of the object to properly assign to correct object. 
</p>

<h3>Spurious Detections</h3>
<p>
The object tracking software will display the objects tracking in the resulting image 
and will disappear after short display of on the image. 
</p>

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Different kinematic models</h3>
<p>
We can also consider different kinematic models such as velocity and accelartion of the object. 
The advanaced kinematic model can improve data association when the object is very close to each
other, such as occulsion. By observing and tracking the velocity of the object, we can 
have the object assigned to data point estimation where the velocity is similar to before occulsion.

<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<p>
In the project, we were able to perform the kalman filter. However, we were not able to successfully 
execute the data association method using the hungarian algorithm.
